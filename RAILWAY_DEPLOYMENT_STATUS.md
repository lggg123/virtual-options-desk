# ✅ Railway Deployment - Final Status

## 🎉 All Fixed and Cleaned Up!

### ✅ What We Did

1. **Moved ML models** from `/ml_models/` → `/python/ml_models/` (11.8MB)
2. **Created Dockerfile** at `python/Dockerfile` (Railway can find it now)
3. **Created railway.json** at `python/railway.json` (tells Railway to use Dockerfile)
4. **Deleted old files** that Railway couldn't see:
   - ❌ `Dockerfile.pattern` (was at repo root)
   - ❌ `railway-pattern-detection.json` (was at repo root)
   - ❌ `nixpacks-pattern.toml` (not needed, using Dockerfile)

### 📂 Current Structure

```

│   ├── Dockerfile              ✅ Railway uses this

```

### 🚀 Railway Configuration

#### In Railway Dashboard:

```
Service: pattern-detection-api
Root Directory: python

That's it! Everything else is auto-detected from:
- python/railway.json (build config)
- python/Dockerfile (build instructions)
```

#### Environment Variables to Add:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

Don't add PORT - Railway sets it automatically.

### 🧪 How to Verify Deployment

#### 1. Check Build Logs

Look for Dockerfile steps (not Nixpacks):

```
✅ GOOD (Using Dockerfile):
Step 1/10 : FROM python:3.12-slim
Step 2/10 : WORKDIR /app
Step 5/10 : RUN pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
Step 6/10 : COPY . /app          ← Copies ml_models/
```

```
❌ BAD (Still using Nixpacks):
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3...
COPY . /app
(No numbered steps, generic commands)
```

#### 2. Check Deployment Logs

Look for model loading:

```
✅ Models loading:
Loading ML models from ml_models/...
✓ XGBoost loaded (217KB)
✓ Random Forest loaded (9.1MB)
✓ LightGBM loaded (1.4MB)
✓ LSTM loaded from premium/ (819KB)
Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

#### 3. Test Endpoints

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health

# Expected:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "ml_enabled": true,
  "models_loaded": ["xgboost", "random_forest", "lightgbm", "lstm"]
}

# ML predictions
curl -X POST https://your-service.railway.app/api/ml/screen \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"symbol": "AAPL", "timeframe": "1d"}'

# Expected:
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "predictions": {
    "ensemble_score": 0.12,
    "lstm_prediction": 0.08,
    "confidence": "medium"
  },
  "patterns": [...]
}
```

2. Deployments → Click ⋮ on latest
3. Click "Redeploy"

### Option 2: Clean Deploy
1. Delete the pattern-detection-api service
2. Create new service from GitHub

4. Railway auto-detects railway.json

### Option 3: Manual Override
1. Settings → Build
2. Builder: "Dockerfile"
3. Dockerfile Path: "Dockerfile"
