# 🎉 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FIXED!

## ✅ Problem Solved

### Error You Got
```
error: Your project's URL and Key are required to create a Supabase client!
```

This happened because the Supabase environment variables weren't set in your local development environment.

### Solution Applied ✅
Created `/frontend/.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://qcwtkyxvejcogbhbauey.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
```

## 🚀 Server Status

### Dev Server is NOW RUNNING with Environment Variables! ✓

```
✓ Ready in 2.4s
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Network:      http://10.0.3.158:3000

```

The server now has access to your Supabase configuration!

## 📝 What's in .env.local

```bash
# ✅ Supabase Configuration (ACTIVE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://qcwtkyxvejcogbhbauey.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...

# ⚠️ Still Need (Get from Supabase Dashboard)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# ⚠️ Still Need (For payment testing)
PAYMENT_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# ⚠️ Still Need (Get from Stripe Dashboard)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

## 🔑 Missing Keys (Optional for Now)

### 1. Supabase Service Role Key
**Needed for:** API routes that need admin access to Supabase

**How to get:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings → API
4. Copy the `service_role` key (starts with `eyJhbG...`)
5. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

### 2. Stripe Keys (For Subscription Testing)
**Needed for:** Payment/subscription functionality

**How to get:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Copy "Publishable key" (starts with `pk_test_`)
3. Copy "Secret key" (click "Reveal" - starts with `sk_test_`)
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   ```

### 3. Payment API URL
**Needed for:** Connecting to payment backend

**Options:**
- Local: `http://localhost:3001` (if running payment API locally)
- Deployed: `https://your-payment-api.railway.app`

## 🔍 Next: Debug Subscription Button

Now that the Supabase error is fixed, let's test the subscription functionality:

### Step 1: Visit Diagnostic Page
```
http://localhost:3000/diagnose
```

### Step 2: Click Each Button
1. **"Test Payment API Health"** - Tests if payment API is reachable
2. **"Test Checkout Endpoint"** - Tests if checkout flow works
3. **"Test Pricing Page"** - Tests if pricing page loads

### Step 3: Share Results
Tell me what each popup alert says! This will show us:
- ✅ Is payment API running?
- ✅ Are Stripe keys configured?
- ✅ Is the subscription flow working?

---

## 💾 File Changes

Created:
- ✅ `/frontend/.env.local` - Environment variables for local development

The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed (keeps secrets safe!)

---

## 🚀 For Deployment

When deploying to Vercel/Railway, add these environment variables in the dashboard:

### Vercel Dashboard
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://qcwtkyxvejcogbhbauey.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
PAYMENT_API_URL=https://your-payment-api.railway.app
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # Use LIVE keys for production!
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
```

---
