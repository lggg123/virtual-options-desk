# üîß Supabase URL Configuration - Quick Fix

## Problem
Email confirmation links are redirecting to `localhost` instead of your production domain `https://www.marketstockpick.com`.

## Solution
Update your Supabase Authentication settings to use the correct production URLs.

---

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Select your project

### 2. Update Site URL
1. Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**
2. Find **Site URL** field
3. Change from `http://localhost:3000` to:
   ```
   https://www.marketstockpick.com
   ```
4. Click **Save**

### 3. Update Redirect URLs
1. In the same **URL Configuration** section
2. Find **Redirect URLs** field
3. Add these URLs (comma-separated):
   ```
   https://www.marketstockpick.com/auth/callback,
   https://www.marketstockpick.com/dashboard,
   https://www.marketstockpick.com/login,
   https://www.marketstockpick.com/signup,
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback,
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard,
   http://localhost:3000/login,
   http://localhost:3000/signup
   ```
4. Click **Save**

### 4. Verify Email Template Variables
The email templates use `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` which automatically uses the Site URL you configured.

**No changes needed to email templates!** They will automatically use `https://www.marketstockpick.com` once you update the Site URL setting.
