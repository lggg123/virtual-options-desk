Start: uvicorn python.pattern_detection_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
Health: /health
Region: Oregon
```

#### ML Stock Screening API

Health: /health
Region: Oregon
```

### 3. Documentation Created
- **`RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Testing commands
  - Troubleshooting
  - iOS integration examples

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture & Configuration

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Railway No Longer Supports Direct Dockerfile Selection

**Use Nixpacks config files instead:**
- Pattern Detection: `nixpacks-pattern.toml` ✅
- CrewAI Service: `nixpacks-crewai.toml` ✅

---

# Deployment Ready - All Services Configured

### Option A: Via Render Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
3. New + → Blueprint
4. Connect repo: `lggg123/virtual-options-desk`
5. Click "Apply"
6. Wait 5-10 minutes

### Option B: Via Render CLI
```bash
# Install Render CLI
npm install -g render-cli

# Login
render login

# Deploy
render blueprint create
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, make sure:

- [x] `render.yaml` exists
- [x] `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.12
- [x] `python/requirements-ml.txt` has all dependencies
- [x] API imports fixed for production
- [x] Health endpoints exist (`/health`)
- [x] CORS configured (currently allows all origins)
- [ ] **Code pushed to GitHub** ← DO THIS NOW
- [ ] **Render account created** at render.com
- [ ] **GitHub repo connected** to Render

---

## 🎯 After Deployment

### 1. Get Your URLs
Render will give you:
```
https://pattern-detection-api-xxxx.onrender.com
https://ml-stock-screening-api-xxxx.onrender.com
```

### 2. Test Endpoints
```bash
# Pattern Detection
curl https://pattern-detection-api-xxxx.onrender.com/health

curl -X POST https://pattern-detection-api-xxxx.onrender.com/api/patterns/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol": "AAPL", "timeframe": "1d"}'

# ML API
curl https://ml-stock-screening-api-xxxx.onrender.com/health
```

### 3. Update iOS App
```swift
struct APIConfig {
    static let patternAPI = "https://pattern-detection-api-xxxx.onrender.com"
    static let mlAPI = "https://ml-stock-screening-api-xxxx.onrender.com"
    static let supabaseURL = "https://nxgtznzhnzlfcofkfbay.supabase.co"
}
```

### 4. Update iOS API Reference
Replace `[your-codespace]` URLs in `docs/IOS_API_REFERENCE.md` with your actual Render URLs.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Cold Starts (~30-60s first request)
**Solution**: This is normal for free tier. Options:
1. Accept it (users see loading spinner)
2. Keep warm with cron job pinging `/health`
3. Upgrade to paid ($7/month per service)

### Issue: ModuleNotFoundError in production
**Solution**: Already fixed with fallback imports:
```python
try:
    from pattern_detector import PatternDetector
except ImportError:
    from python.pattern_detector import PatternDetector
```

### Issue: ML models not found
**Solution**: Models aren't deployed yet. Options:
1. Train models locally, commit to repo (small models)
2. Use Render disk storage (paid feature)
3. Load from S3/external storage

## ✨ You're Ready!

Everything is configured and ready to deploy. Just:

1. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`
2. **Deploy on Render**: Connect repo, click Apply
3. **Test APIs**: curl the /health endpoints
4. **Update iOS**: Use new production URLs

That's it! 🎉

## 📚 Next Steps After Deployment

1. [ ] Test Pattern Detection API from iOS
2. [ ] Test ML API from iOS
3. [ ] Train ML models (if needed)
4. [ ] Set up monitoring (UptimeRobot)
5. [ ] Add API authentication
6. [ ] Update CORS to production URLs only
7. [ ] Consider upgrading if cold starts are issue
