# Multi-Tier ML System Architecture

## üéØ Goal: Justify Price Tiers with Real Value

### Free Tier ($0/month)
- **10 AI picks/month**
- **Basic model**: Simple momentum + RSI screening
- **Universe**: Top 50 liquid stocks only
- **Features**: 20 basic technical indicators
- **Update frequency**: Daily
- **No advanced ML**

---

### Pro Tier ($29.99/month) ‚ö°
- **100 AI picks/month**
- **Ensemble model**: XGBoost + Random Forest + LightGBM (from Colab notebook)
- **Universe**: 150+ stocks (tech, finance, healthcare, energy)
- **Features**: 85+ advanced features including:
  - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
  - Price momentum (1d, 5d, 20d, 60d)
  - Volume patterns
  - Volatility measures
- **Update frequency**: Daily at market close
- **Pattern detection**: Standard chart patterns
- **Support**: Email support (24-48h response)

---

### Premium Tier ($99.99/month) üëë

#### Additional ML Models:
1. **Deep Learning LSTM** (time-series prediction)
   - Analyzes sequential price patterns
   - Better at capturing momentum shifts
   - Requires more compute (GPU training)

2. **Sentiment Analysis Model**
   - Real-time news sentiment from financial APIs
   - Social media sentiment (Reddit, Twitter/X)
   - Analyst ratings and price targets
   - **Weights sentiment into final score**

3. **Fundamental Analysis Model**
   - P/E ratios, earnings growth, revenue trends
   - Sector rotation signals
   - Economic indicators (Fed rates, CPI, etc.)
   - **200+ factor analysis**

4. **Options Flow Analysis**
   - Unusual options activity detection
   - Dark pool prints
   - Institutional buying/selling signals
   - **Real-time alerts**

#### Enhanced Features:
- **Unlimited AI picks** (full universe screening)
- **Universe**: 2000+ stocks (S&P 500, Russell 2000, NASDAQ)
- **Real-time streaming** (WebSocket updates, not just daily)
- **Custom ML models** (user can configure weights, factors)
- **Backtesting engine** (test strategies historically)
- **API access** (integrate with your own tools)
- **Portfolio optimization** (AI suggests position sizing)
- **Risk analytics** (VaR, correlation matrices, beta)
- **24/7 priority support** (live chat)

## üîß Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Pro Tier (Current Colab Notebook) ‚úÖ
- Train ensemble models (XGBoost, RF, LightGBM)
- 85+ technical features
- 150+ stock universe
- **STATUS: Ready to deploy**

### Phase 2: Premium Tier - LSTM Model
Create second Colab notebook: `train_lstm_model.ipynb`
- Use PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Time-series sequences (60-day windows)
- Predict next 30-day returns
- **Requires GPU** (Colab provides free GPU)

### Phase 3: Premium Tier - Sentiment Analysis
- Integrate NewsAPI or Finnhub for financial news
- Use pre-trained sentiment models (FinBERT, Twitter-RoBERTa)
- Score sentiment on scale of -1 to +1
- Weight into final AI pick score

### Phase 4: Premium Tier - Fundamental Analysis
- Fetch fundamental data (yfinance, Alpha Vantage, FMP)
- Calculate valuation ratios, growth metrics
- Train separate model for fundamental signals
- Combine with technical ensemble

### Phase 5: Premium Tier - Options Flow
- Integrate with options data provider (CBOE, Tradier)
- Detect unusual volume, open interest spikes
- Track institutional money flow
- Real-time WebSocket alerts

## üöÄ Quick Start for You

**Today (Right Now):**
1. Train the Pro-tier models in Colab (ensemble)
2. Deploy to production
3. This handles both Free (limited picks) and Pro tiers

**Next Week:**
1. Create LSTM notebook for Premium tier
2. Add sentiment analysis integration
3. These are Premium-only features

**Next Month:**
1. Add fundamental analysis
2. Build backtesting engine
3. Implement API access

## üìù Recommendation

Start with the current Colab notebook to get **Pro tier working**. Then progressively add Premium features. This way:
- ‚úÖ Immediate revenue from Pro subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Clear upgrade path to Premium
- ‚úÖ Justifiable 3.3x price increase ($29.99 ‚Üí $99.99)

Want me to:
1. **Create the LSTM training notebook** for Premium tier?
2. **Set up sentiment analysis integration**?
3. **Build the tiered access control** in your backend?
